# Engineering Foundation

## Core Components

- Workload shape and traffic pattern
- Control mechanism or data structure
- Failure handling and retry policy
- Storage, network, or compute constraints
- Metrics and alerts

## How It Works Internally

Bloom Filters works by making an explicit engineering tradeoff. The system accepts constraints such as memory, latency, consistency, ordering, or operational complexity in exchange for better behavior under realistic load.

## Request or Data Flow

1. A client, producer, or worker creates work.
2. The system applies the Bloom Filters design decision.
3. State is read, written, routed, cached, filtered, or queued.
4. The result is returned, stored, or delivered downstream.
5. Metrics confirm whether the design is meeting its goal.

## Design Tradeoffs

- Simpler designs are easier to operate but may hit scale limits earlier.
- More distributed designs improve capacity but introduce coordination costs.
- Stronger guarantees often increase latency or reduce availability.

## Failure Modes

- Hot spots or overloaded components
- Stale, duplicated, delayed, or lost work
- Incorrect retry behavior
- Missing visibility into saturation and errors

## Production Best Practices

- Define success metrics before implementation
- Test overload and dependency failure cases
- Add dashboards for false positive probability, bit-array size, number of hash functions, and insert count
- Document operational limits and recovery steps
