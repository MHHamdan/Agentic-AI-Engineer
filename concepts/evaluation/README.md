# 📖 Concepts · Evaluation

> 🟢 Stable explainers · concepts/evaluation/ covers RAG evaluation as a discipline. This is the *primer* on evaluation that the rest of Path 02 needs; the production-grade treatment (frameworks, observability, drift detection) lives in [Path 06](../../learning-paths/).

The pages here are a four-step progression from "what is RAG evaluation" to "what metrics to compute on what." They're prerequisites for [Lab 09](../../labs/09-evaluating-agentic-rag/) and the synthesis of Path 02's Labs 06-08.

## Current pages

### The primer

| Page | Read time | Covers |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 📖 [what-is-rag-evaluation.md](./what-is-rag-evaluation.md) | ~10 min | Orientation: retrieval vs generation, offline vs online, correctness vs groundedness, what evaluation can and can't tell you. |
| 📖 [eval-set-construction.md](./eval-set-construction.md) | ~10 min | The foundation: 30-50 hand-curated queries beat 1000 synthetic ones; expected_chunks/expected_doc, reference answers, category and failure-label tagging. |
| 📖 [retrieval-metrics.md](./retrieval-metrics.md) | ~11 min | Hits@k, recall@k, precision@k, MRR, nDCG@k, mean rank of expected chunk. What each reveals and what it hides. |
| 📖 [answer-quality-metrics.md](./answer-quality-metrics.md) | ~11 min | Faithfulness, groundedness, citation accuracy, answer relevance, refusal quality. Rule-based vs LLM-as-judge; Zheng et al. 2023's documented biases. |

These four pages are prerequisites for [Lab 09: Evaluating agentic RAG](../../labs/09-evaluating-agentic-rag/).

## Pending pages (future paths)

The following live in [Path 06](../../learning-paths/) (not yet authored):

- `production-evaluation.md` — observability, drift detection, A/B testing on real traffic.
- `evaluation-frameworks.md` — RAGAS, TruLens, DeepEval in depth, with framework comparisons and migration paths.
- `synthetic-eval-generation.md` — when and how to expand the seed set programmatically.

## Where this is used

- 🧪 [Lab 09: Evaluating agentic RAG](../../labs/09-evaluating-agentic-rag/) — implements the metrics from this section from scratch over Labs 06-08's pipeline.
- 🗺 [Path 02 — Agentic RAG](../../learning-paths/02-agentic-rag/) — Module 11 (this section + Lab 09) closes Path 02 v1.
